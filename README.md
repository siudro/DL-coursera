# Coursera's Deep Learning Specialization 
## About
The [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) is a foundational program that will assist students in learning the benefits, drawbacks, and implications of deep learning as well as preparing them to take part in the creation of cutting-edge AI technology. The [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) foundation presented this specialization on Coursera, hence,images,datasets copy rights belong to DeepLearning.AI and their partners.
Building and training neural network architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, LSTMs, and Transformers as well as learning how to optimize them using techniques like Dropout, BatchNorm, and Xavier/He initialization were all part of this Specialization. Including the applications of NNs in real-world scenarios like speech recognition, music synthesis, chatbots, machine translation, and natural language processing using Python and TensorFlow.

This repository contains all of my submissions for the specialization courses requirements and made for educational purposes only.
